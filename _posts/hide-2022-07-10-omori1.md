### welcome to WHITE SPACE

![Image](http://lpix.org/3932698/omoriup1_0012.png){:.rounded}

this is how the game starts. wait, what? you don't even get to select your own name...

you wake up in a white void, with only a few things, all colored in black, surrounding you: a computer, a box of tissues, your sketchbook, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MEWO</span> the cat, and a black lightbulb. exploring the void reveals nothing much, either: go too far in any direction and red squiggly hands teleport you back to the center. you can find a knife, which i guess is your first weapon, but that's about it. 

pressing X shows a little item menu, sorta like your backpack in pokemon. your protagonist's name is (quite obviously) <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span>, a preteen/early teenage boy dressed in black with a blank expression. but still, it feels off...like, how are you not allowed to name the main character? it sorta takes the rp out of rpg, huh. 

there's clearly no one else to talk to, so i tried talking to <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MEWO</span>. 

Meow? (Waiting for something to happen?)
{:.omori-greybox}

oh yeah, i forgot to mention, there's one last thing in <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">WHITE SPACE</span>: a white door. yeah, i probably need to open that. 

![Image](https://www.talonmarks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/neighbors-room.png){:.rounded}

on the other end, you're greeted by your friends (in the image, starting from the first one behind <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span>) <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">AUBREY</span>, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">KEL</span>, and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HERO</span>. <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">KEL</span> and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">AUBREY</span> seem to be about your age, while <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HERO</span> at least acts slightly older. ascending the stairway takes you outside...

and a measly fifteen minutes into your playthrough, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> finally touches grass. walking down from the tree stump takes you to a playground filled with other kids. there, you meet your older sister <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span> and another friend of yours, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>. he's the one with the flower crown. 

![Image](https://gamedom.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Omori-Video-Game-PLayground.jpg){:.rounded}

talking with them for a while, you get a good sense of how everyone's related. 

* <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span> are siblings
* <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HERO</span> is <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">KEL</span>'s older brother
* <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HERO</span> and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span> are around 15-16 and are in a relationship, which means
* <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> and his remaining three friends are around 12-13. 

after fighting your first boss battle against...well, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BOSS</span>, the six of you head to <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>'s house to hang out and look through his <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">PHOTO ALBUM</span>, his most prized posession because for some reason <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> likes taking pictures of you guys when you're not looking. wait -- not in the creepy way, in the way that everyone's in the moment and not specifically *posing* for a picture. well, all of you except for <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span>, who has a bad knee and stays behind on the picnic basket. 

oh yeah, speaking of the picnic basket, that's how you save the game and heal up. one last thing <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span> says to all of you is: 

Don't forget to SAVE!
{:.omori-greybox}

*oh hell no*. sweet, friendly, helpful characters who break the fourth wall? she better not end up being another [Monika](https://doki-doki-literature-club.fandom.com/wiki/Monika_(DDLC)) or else i scream. 

on the way there, you battle your second boss, learning from <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HERO</span> the basic battle mechanics, including follow-ups and the most important battle mechanic, emotions. yup, that's right -- how do you win? play with other people's feelings, of course! ~~<span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HERO</span> sure knows how to get ahead.~~

![Image](https://gamedom.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Omori-Video-Game-Emotion-Chart.jpg){:.rounded}

something seems off, though. <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">KEL</span> and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">AUBREY</span> seems to be switched on the chart, since <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">AUBREY</span> has the skill that makes people happy while <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">KEL</span> has the skill that makes people angry; same for <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HERO</span> and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> having the opposite emotional skills. 

i'm always trying to preict where the game's plot will go, so at this point i see that the two oldest group members seem to have fourth-wall-breaking knowledge and immediately my suspicion's on them two. if this game's about sibling abuse, then no wonder this game displays a trigger warning every time it loads up. 

when they finally reach <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>'s house and begin looking through photos, one drops. but when <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> goes to pick it up, his eyes turn red and he freaks out. 

N-No...that can't be...\
MARI...she's --
{:.omori-greybox}

a black void appears beneath him, and you get jumpscared. 

yup. i think i'm right. 

you're then teleported back into <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">WHITE SPACE</span> -- just you, no friends, and interestingly enough, no door. you go exploring, but still find nothing...and a heart starts beating in the background. talking to <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MEWO</span> doesn't seem to help much, either. 

Meow? (Not much to do around here, is there?)\
Meow? (Or is there?)\
Meow? (Are you looking for a way out?)\
Meow...(There always is one...but...)\
Meow? (When is Mom coming back?)
{:.omori-greybox}

come to think of it. where *are* everyone's parents? why is that all jrpg characters don't have parents who are at least present in the game? idk. 

on a whim, i opened the menu to see if <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> got any new stuff from his little playtime outside. 

![Image](https://gamedom.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Omori-Video-Game-Stab-How-Disturbing-Scene-011.jpg)

**no. no, no, no, no.** 

> <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">There always is one...but...</span>

*are you kidding me.*

yes, the game actually animates it. wtf. 

it then plays a cutscene of <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> standing over a bunch of photos, reminiscing over them. 

These are all our memories together...\
They're a little sad now...\
...\
Let's make some new memories together, okay?
{:.omori-greybox}

---

okay so. at this point in the game, i'm thinking that <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HERO</span> and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span> are our companions who will turn out to be the main villains all along. they can break the fourth wall, they managed to freak <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> out and disappear him...yeah. i'm not putting much trust in those two. 

it seems like the six of them got along well in the past, but something happened between them, and the once-sweet and caring older siblings are abusive. i reckon we're somehow going have to save both of them from themselves, and have a happy ending of getting their former, caring selves back. yeah, that really does sound like a [jrpg plot](https://earthbound.fandom.com/wiki/Mother_3). 

### you see a boy sleeping in his room. what's his name?

*ah! so it **was** just all a dream!* 

*now* i have the option to choose a name, the default name being <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span>. it's now pretty clear that <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> is his dream persona...still doesn't explain the horrific way he had to leave his own dream though. 

<span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span> wakes up in the middle of the night. interacting with the phone gives us the real-life backstory of our game: his family's moving, and he's home alone because his mom's busy with the new house. there's no mention of dad, so this is definitely a single-mother family...but where's <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span>? his mom's talking to him like he's an only child. if <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span> were there, his mom would have called her instead to have her explain everything to her little brother. so, she's probably in college. <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span> is probably older than <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span>, given the previous cutscene referring to old memories and the fact that he can be left at home alone for an extended period of time. 

also, it seems like <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span>'s friends are, or were, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span>'s friends. seems like <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span>'s created a little dream universe for himself when he sleeps. no, really -- apparently that's a thing. lucid dreaming is being aware that you're dreaming during your dreams, giving you the ability to somethimes change what you see in them. i dream a lot, but never have any control over it so yeah. jealous. 

going downstairs to try get a midnight snack triggers a battle with <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span>'s fear of heights. i actually hate the way it starts -- the screen darkens and only a small spotlight of light is visible around you; then, a giant grimy hand grabs you from behind. you then learn to <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">CALM DOWN</span> to defeat your fear. 

once you're downstairs, you hear a knock at the door. it's <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span>, who forgot her keys. you're given the choice to open the door or ignore her (weird -- why ignore your own sister?) so i opened it. 

*bad choice.*

a hellish version of her appears, with her neck at a 90-degree angle and a wide, gaping mouth. apparently the sprite's aptly named <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HELLMARI</span>. yup. that's why there was an ignore option. 

and that's why his mom didn't mention her - *she's dead*. 

yeah, that's enough. i'm going back to sleep. 

---

i have predictions to update. how did <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span> die? judging from that neck, and judging by this game's self-harm references, probably hanging herself. this would also tie into <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>'s interrupted last words: 

> <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI's...she's <b>dead</b></span>

and as soon as he referenced that traumatic real-life event, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span>'s dream stopped as he snapped back to reality. 

i guess the course of this game will be finding out why...and maybe finding some peace and healing. after all, he still is moving in three days -- if there's any way his old friends can get some closure, it has to be now. 

### close your eyes...

...and i'm back in <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">WHITE SPACE</span> as <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span>. the game doesn't let me go through the door, so i look in my sketchbook and my computer to find that my computer's now only runs a game of hangman. *hangman.* yeah, i think i'm right with my prediction, sadly. i'm not given any letters, and it seems like the letters are strewn throughout the dream world, which i also conveniently get a map for after closing your laptop. 

now i can leave. obviously, my three remaining friends are pretty worried about losing <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>, so off we go to find him -- first in the <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">VAST FOREST</span>, then climbing a ladder all the way up to the moon to the <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OTHERWORLD</span>. there, we find that the only person who might be able to help us, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SPACE BOYFRIEND</span>, is heartbroken over a breakup with <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SWEETHEART</span>. in an attempt to get him to his senses, we need to find a special item of his, which was a bossfight in and of itself. 

so i'm over here thinking, "oh we just had a bossfight, i won't need to save or heal up before confronting <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SPACE BOYFRIEND</span> again." yeah no. once we get back, we confront him, and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">AUBREY</span> taunts him for his breakup, calling him <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SPACE EX-BOYFRIEND</span>. we immediately get thrown into *another* bossfight. 

it seems like <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> (or is it his real-life counterpart <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span>?) has some sort of control over his own dream world, given that after <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">AUBREY</span>'s taunt, the space captain's name immediately changed from <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SPACE BOYFRIEND</span> to ex. 

after defeating him, however, only <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> moves, and any attempt to get his three friends to come with me sorta failed, so i just gave up and ditched them. instead, a shadowy figure who sorta looked like <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> led me to a letter in the hangman puzzle; after collecting the letter a black void in the shape of a teardrop appeared to jumpscare me, and i was teleported back into <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">WHITE SPACE</span>. 

so when i wake up, it should be morning, right? hopefully...

---

seems like the truth will be revealed once i complete the hangman puzzle. 

i wonder if there's an option to go out and visit my old friends the next morning...that'd probably be the move.
