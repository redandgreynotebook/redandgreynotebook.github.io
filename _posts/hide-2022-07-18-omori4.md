yes, the final boss is worth its own entry. also, go take a listen to "my time" by bo en. then these titles will make sense.

tw: depictions of trauma, depression, and suicide. just overall pretty heavy stuff.

### OMORI

i, as <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span>, created him and the dream world as a way of coping with what happened. if i had the dream world, where my sister still loved me and still was alive, i wouldn't have to deal with reality. i could spend long days and longer nights dreaming, replaying my life as a twelve-year-old on repeat. and indeed, i did truly live there for as long as i can remember, as everything else was repressed into <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BLACK SPACE</span>. no, my sister is still alive; she's just not here with us because she has a bad knee. <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>? who's that? there's only the four of us here. <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> was there to keep me safe -- safe from my fears, safe from the truth, safe from myself. so when he knew i had found the truth, he had to act, to protect me, to make sure i wouldn't hurt myself more by confessing to my friends. 

...or, that's probably what he was thinking as he held his knife in front of me. 

interestingly enough, of the four skills i'd learned -- <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">CALM DOWN</span>, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">FOCUS</span>, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">PERSIST</span>, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OVERCOME</span> -- only the first remained; the other three were different. <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">ALLEGRO</span> dealt half his healthbar, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">ENCORE</span> gave me the equivalent of infinite skill points/mana for three turns, and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">CHERISH</span> healed both health and mana back to full. the first phase was really easy, but i knew there'd be more to come -- after all, even in dream world, if <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> were to take fatal damage, he's get a second chance, remaining on 1 hp becuase 

OMORI did not succumb.
{:.omori-greybox}

yup, it was being used against me. in phase 2, he got a bit redder; he's clearly tapping into whatever powers he had in the dream world. 

OMORI erases the enemy.
{:.omori-greybox}

red hands cover me, and i take a third of my healthbar in damage. but no worries -- <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">CALM DOWN</span> heals for half my healthbar! 

You've caused so much suffering...yet you do nothing.\
And so you've earned nothing in return.\
Your friends will never forgive you.\
They'll abandon you like you did them...\
...and that's what you deserve.
{:.omori-greybox-2}

*wait what.* remember that <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> never talked when i played as him, and yet here he is, spitting all of <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span>'s hateful thoughts right back at him. 

OMORI did not succumb.
{:.omori-greybox}

the background music grows distorted. it was already a sad, longing violin melody, but now there's static in the background. the notes become off tune, and warped. 

When do you think about others? How long are you going to let other people take care of you?\
You say you care but you're a liar. You've never done anything for anyone else.\
You're useless...less than useless.\
You're sick.
{:.omori-greybox-2}

now he's sitting on his throne of hands. his new erase attack deals even more damage, and lowers my stats too. he makes me weaker while he himself becomes stronger every passing turn. if this is a battle with mental health, then...i'm losing, aren't i? 

OMORI did not succumb.
{:.omori-greybox}

<span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span>'s skull now appears in the background as well. 

You're nothing but a liar...and when they see the truth...\
They'll hate you just as much as you hate yourself.\
If they know the truth, you'll never be able to regain their trust.\
No matter what you do, it will be hopeless.\
All you'll do is make things worse.\
It would be better to just die.
{:.omori-greybox-2}

oh. i see how it is now. in his twisted idea of protection, he thinks the only way out, the only way for me to not hurt, is for me to take this secret to my grave. 

but anyhow. this is phase 4 already. how many phases does this guy have? 

OMORI will not succumb.
{:.omori-greybox}

wait...he *will* not succumb? i somehow manage to survive and take him down again, though...

OMORI will not succumb.
{:.omori-greybox}

the background is horrifying. along with the skull, the silhouettes of my four remaining friends are also shown hanging. as if the guilt of all their suffering -- <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HERO</span>'s depression, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">AUBREY</span>'s anger, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">KEL</span>'s forced positivity, and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>'s nervous breakdowns -- they're all my fault, aren't they. 

You should just die.
{:.omori-greybox-2}

his erase attacks now make me afraid, so i can't even attack back. all i can do is <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">CALM DOWN</span>.

You should just die.
{:.omori-greybox-2}

can we talk about the attack? as opposed to the previous four, which only attacked me in my own little corner avatar, this attack takes up the whole screen. red tendrils fan out from <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span>'s heart, covering the entire screen. 

it's so different from the previous four: the first two were attacks with red hands, representing <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span>'s control over <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span>'s dream world. when that didn't work, he switched to guilt-tripping, with the next two erase attacks being <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span>'s hair and a <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HELLMARI</span> jumpscare. 

but this one's different. the red means everything -- every bad memory, every unspeakable thought <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span>'s ever locked away in <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BLACK SPACE</span> is coming out of their corners, and this time, there's no one to push them back down. they come out, and they completely consume me. 

You should just die.
{:.omori-greybox-2}

it even deals more than half my healthbar. what the hell. i thought <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HUMPHREY</span> made me feel helpless, but this is something else. i'm fighting for control of my own mind, and i'm scared i won't win. 

i'm fighting to not kill myself, *and i'm going to lose.*

You should just die.
{:.omori-greybox-2}

and i do. it turns out that this *is* one of those scripted, unwinnable boss fights. but damn. that means there's no "good" ending? that's soul-crushing. 

Do you wish to continue?
{:.omori-greybox}

### good morning

saying yes means you continue living, giving you the good ending. i get back up, pick up my violin, and finally finish that song we were supposed to play together. 

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='8ya9EhvcNsA' -%}</div>

<span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> collapses into my arms, and fades away -- forever a part of me, but no longer in control like he once was. 

i wake up, in the hospital, and make my way to <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>'s hospital room (right -- we did just fight and nearly kill each other). there, all my friends are with him, and i speak my first (and last) words of dialogue. 

I have to tell you something.
{:.omori-greybox}

it does end there, with that open ending. for me, i thought it's because it doesn't matter if the three forgive him or not -- he's forgiven himself, learned to move on, and that's really the best he can do. 

and maybe, just maybe, everything is going to be okay. 

### it's a long way down...

saying no makes the opposite happen -- i fade into his arms, and he takes control. i wake up in <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">WHITE SPACE</span>, and opening the door and going outside leads me not to the dream world, but to the hospital balcony. 

It's a long way down...do you want to jump?

### end. 

pretty good game. this might just be a problem of the genre, but i feel like there aren't many psychological horror games that don't have like 15 mental health trigger warnings with them, and this one's no exception. so far, i haven't found one yet, but i'm still on the search -- and maybe, i'll find one that somehow still does the horror well without going into too heavy of topics. 

but that's going to wait, as i have my eyes set on [end roll](https://vgperson.com/games/endroll.htm) next.
