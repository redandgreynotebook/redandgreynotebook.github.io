### welcome to BLACK SPACE

an inverted version of <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">WHITE SPACE</span>, just a black void, filled with doors. each door leads to some weird, distorted room, where you can't make out the terrain; you can seemingly walk through walls sometimes and get stuck walking into nothing some other times. the background's overall dark shades of grey and black, and distorted version of characters i've already seen populate the rooms. but, in every room, there's always one person to meet me: ghost <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>, the same one who led me away in <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OTHERWORLD</span>. he has a different name now: <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">STRANGER</span>, and keeps on saying cryptic things about the past choices i made. 

a pitch-black room, broken only by crude drawings of weeping willows and stick figures. 

a grey town, where every house looks the same: a grey wooden shack with a clock on its roof, telling me it's 10:05.

a grey corridor, where every few steps i take i get called a <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">Liar.</span>, only to meet my own personal teardrop-shaped void at the end. it gets given a name, too -- <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SOMETHING</span>. it says it loves me, over and over again. thanks, dead sister. 

an operating table, where the only thing i can do is to cut open the patient, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MEWO</span>. 

an empty beach littered with photographs, but every time i try and pick one up it turns into black squigglies, almost as if someone drew over them. 

a black field of watermelons. here, i finally meet someone i can talk to: not <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">STRANGER</span>, actual colored, dream world <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>. *so that's where he went since the start.* 

then he dies. over, and over, and over again. 

i'm just cutting open watermelons, trying to find some items, when i realize that i'd cut open <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> instead. 

he and i were taking an elevator up to our treehouse, but the elevator closes its doors on him, crushing him. 

we try and go rafting together, but after we pass under a tunnel, i'm the only one left with my head intact. 

we try playing with our friends, but distorted versions of <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">KEL</span> and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">AUBREY</span> beat him into the ground. 

several mental breakdown-rooms later, i ascend the stairs to church and, instead of there being a pastor at the pulpit, it's <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>, half-eaten by his own personal black void <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SOMETHING</span>. i try to save him, only for me to be transported into a space with a red background, and a single set of stairs leading all the way up to <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>, who, again, is in distress. this time, he's being held by red hands. he begs and pleads for me to help him, let him go, but i twist my knife into his stomach instead. red hands then carry me up to the throne of hands, and there i sit, god of the dream world.

so. if the dream world's a fantasy coping mechanism, and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> is <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span>'s counterpart in it, then <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> knows something that i don't yet, since <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OMORI</span> has been repressing the memory every time it turns up. <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> was banished to <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BLACK SPACE</span> for even trying to mention that my sister's dead; then, every time he tries to talk to me in <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BLACK SPACE</span>, he dies. 

the whole place seems like one mental breakdown followed by another, an endless cycle of weird dreams, discombobulated thoughts, and various streams of consciousness and subconsciousness forced to vomit out some sort of picture for me to see. sorta reminds me of the unfiltered, out-of-control stream of consciouness and spiral [this story](https://the-scp.foundation/object/scp-3999) has, but i guess that's for another time. 

### the truth

waking up, the three of us confront <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">AUBREY</span> who, contrary to what i thought (that <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> threw them all away), actually just kept the pictures of <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span> for herself. and finally, she confesses her side of the story. 

after <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span> died, everyone seemed to react differently from her. <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span> and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> pretty much hid from view, with the former not even attending her own funeral. <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HERO</span> went into deep depression for over a year, withdrawing from the group, while <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">KEL</span> seems to go on, make new friends, and overall act not that affected. she tried to reach out to <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> for one last time, only to discover that every picture in the photo album had been scribbled over in black marker. so *that's* what she was referring to when she says "what <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> did," and that's her (however poor) reason for being so mad. 

so *that's* why the emotion chart given at the start of the game seemed to not match up -- it wasn't about who manipulates emotions in the dream world, it was about each person's reactions to <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span>'s death: 

* <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">KEL</span> smiled through it, acting as if nothing big happened and trying to maintain his happy self. 
* <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">HERO</span> became depressed. 
* <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">AUBREY</span> got mad at everyone because she was lost and confused too. 
* and lastly, <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span> chose to repress everything, thus staying expressionless and blind to reality for four years. 

the four of us make up, and no matter how unrealistic i feel like that is, i'm still happy, because so far the real world portions of this game have been nothing but angst and confusion, so i'll take the happy endings i can. 

we try and go to <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>'s house to apologize, but he won't come out of his room; presumably, his grandmother's either comatose or dead, since we're told by her caretaker that he spent most of the day visiting her in the hospital. so, we sleep the night there. 

### the actual truth

i wake up in <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">WHITE SPACE</span> as <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SUNNY</span> this time, and fight <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SOMETHING</span>: the three forms of fear i've already fought, and then it throws its fourth and true form: <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span>'s hanging body. survive a few rounds with <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">PERSIST</span>, which literally prevents me from dying, and i learn to <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">OVERCOME</span> my inner demons. woohoo. 

i then meet <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>, who tells me the truth lies ahead, and asks for forgiveness, again. 

and how does he tell me the truth? the only way he knows how -- through a photo album, of course. 

a photo of a violin, presumably mine, smashed at the bottom of the stairs. 

a photo of <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span>, lying at the bottom of the stairs. 

a photo of me, kneeling next to a bed. 

a photo of me burying my face in my hands. 

a photo of the tree outside. 

a photo of the two of us, at the top of the stairs. 

*no.*

a photo of me, pushing her down. 

*no.*

a photo of <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>, opening my back door. 

*no.*

a photo of a jump rope. 

*oh what the hell.*

a photo of her hanging from the tree. 

okay. ignoring the obvious shock that i killed my own sister and my best friend framed it as a suicide, at first i thought that it was horrifying that twelve-year-old <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> knew how to tie a noose. but then, i remembered: he hung plants from his ceiling all the time; it's just that he used that knowledge for...that. 

*what the hell.* nothing leading up to this suggested that this was how she died. it's almost like the game *wants* you to think she hanged herself, what with the hangman and broken neck jumpscares. that theory in and of itself is dark, but if you accept that theory, there's no way you'd think of anything darker, which is what actually happened. 

i wake up. *i have to confront him.* and there he is, his <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SOMETHING</span> having already consumed half of him. it was me who killed my sister, me who scribbled on his photos...and yet, here he was, a nervous wreck and scapegoated because of me. 

my own <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">SOMETHING</span> appears behind me, too. nervous wrecks and on the verge of breakdown, the two of us fight. for some reason, he has garden shears. both of us pass out. 

### memory lane

i wake up in my head again, but this time, there's no <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">WHITE SPACE</span>; instead, it's a memory of <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">FARAWAY</span>. i make my way home, find <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> there, who wishes me the best of luck in confronting the truth. *yeah, i think i'd need some luck if i were to fight a dimensional overlord, thanks.* i grab my broken violin, and head down a literal memory lane. 

five of us are playing blackjack, when <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span> brings in cookies. i remember the taste, and how it always smelled good knowing she made it from scratch. 

the six of us are at the beach, and the five of them bury me in the sand. i remember the taste of watermelon, and how it always tasted better eating it with everyone in the hot summer. 

we're having a picnic, in the park near the lake. everyone's falled asleep, except for <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span>, and the shutter sound wakes me up. i remember sleeping on <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">MARI</span>'s lap, and how comforted i felt knowing no matter what, she'd keep me safe. 

it's raining, and <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">AUBREY</span> wants to show off her new pink raincoat. i ask <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> for the photo, but he quickly realizes my crush. i remember how red my ears turned then...

<span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">BASIL</span> makes a wish, and blows out his candles. while everyone sings him happy birthday, i remember how i made a wish too...that we will always be together, forever. 

and now i'm at the end of the road. it's christmas, and everyone's saved up to buy me a new violin. they've seen how much time my sister spends playing piano, and maybe if i could play alongside her, i could spend some more time with her. despite my anxiousness, i played my first note, remembering that i had all five of them standing behind me. 

the violin repaired itself. and now i'm backstage. <span style="font-family:OMORI_GAME_2;font-size:large;">AUBREY</span> tells me to break a leg as i walk onstage, put my sheet music on the stand, and try and play the song we were supposed to play together. 

i can't. i collapse and cry. 

i look up, and a boy with a knife looks back at me.
